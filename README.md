# GearVRf-Demos

## How to run these examples
* make sure you have [this repository](https://github.com/gearvrf/GearVRf-Demos) and [the GearVR framework](https://github.com/Samsung/GearVRf) in a sibling directory 

```
git clone https://github.com/Samsung/GearVRf.git -b release_v3.1
git clone https://github.com/gearvrf/GearVRf-Demos.git -b release_v3.1
```

* if you don't have your computer set up for Android [SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html) development - the simplest way to get those configured is to use [NVIDIA's Codeworks](https://developer.nvidia.com/codeworks-android) which will automatically configure your `~/.bash_profile` with several important environment variables. They require a registration (free) to download, but you could also download each of the required tools separately and add the directory paths to `~/.bash_profile` yourself:
 
```
#update version numbers and paths for your local system
export ANDROID_HOME="~/mytools/android-sdk-macosx"
export NDK_ROOT="~/mytools/android-ndk-r11c"
export NDKROOT=$NDK_ROOT
export NVPACK_NDK_VERSION="android-ndk-r11c"
export ANT_HOME="~/mytools/apache-ant-1.8.2"
export GRADLE_HOME="~/mytools/gradle-2.2.1"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools:$NDK_ROOT:$ANT_HOME/bin:$GRADLE_HOME:$PATH"
```

* [download the Oculus_Mobile_SDK](https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/mobile/1.0.4/Oculus_Mobile_SDK/) and put the SDK folder at the same directory level as your GearVRf directory.

```
#edit to use your PATH or make a env variable reference for wherever you unzipped the SDK
export OVR_MOBILE_SDK=~/mytools/ovr_sdk_mobile_1.0.4

```


* make sure you have gradle in your PATH (you can check that your PATH is setup correctly and verify your gradle version by running: `gradle -v` if you get a response, great! if not, [these instructions may help](https://developer.nvidia.com/codeworks-android)

* set up the [Oculus device signature](https://developer.oculus.com/osig/) for your device (it will look like oculussig_xxxxxxxx where xxxxxxxx is the id you get when you run `adb devices`) and copy it into an assets folder each project's `src/main/assets` directory: 

```
cp ~/Downloads/oculussig_xxxxxxxx ./gvr-cubemap/gvrcubemap/src/main/assets/oculussig_xxxxxxxx
```

* change to the example you wish to build and invoke the included gradle wrapper file, `./gradlew` 

```
cd gvr-sample
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

* you should now have an apk that you can push to an android device

```
adb install -r ./app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk
```
NOTE: some of these examples use the application name instead of `app` to hold the apk build directory for instance, in gvr-cubemap, you will find the apk in `./gvr-cubemap/gvrcubemap/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk`

```
cd gvr-cubemap
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -r ./gvrcubemap/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk
```

* if you want to run without loading into a headset, enable Samsung VR Service developer mode: 
	- go to Settings > Applications > manage applications > Gear VR Service > Manage Storage
	- press the VR Service Version 6 times
	- if you get a message 'You are a developer' you should see a toggle to enable developer mode
	- if you get a message 'You are not a developer' you probably haven't installed a valid apk with your oculus signature - run the `adb install -r ./gvrcubemap/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk` command on at least one project, then the service should discover you
