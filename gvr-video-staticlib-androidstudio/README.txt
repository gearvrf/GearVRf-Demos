This is a template project created for app developers. The libs*/* content is empty and should be copied with prebuilt library files from Gear VR and Oculus. Try to get the latest version of prebuilt ones provided to be able to build. More build instructions can be found on the Gear VR wiki pages.
1) collect *.jar and *.so files from GearVRf and Oculus SDK as instructed on the wiki page
2) put all the collected *.jar files into libs folder, e.g., gvr-video-staticlib-androidstuido\gvrvideo\libs\
3) put all the collected *.so files into the libs fodler, e.g., gvr-video-staticlib-androidstuido\gvrvideo\libs\lib\armeabi-v7a\
4) zip the lib\armeabi-v7a\ folder from the libs\ folder, and rename it to lib.jar (to carry the *.so files)
