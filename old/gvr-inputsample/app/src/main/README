GVRf IO

This folder contains files required to implement User Interaction with GVRf using input devices attached to 
the Android device.

GVRf contains modules to help developers integrate input devices faster. For now the framework supports a 
standard mouse along with a few common game controllers(list below).

The InputSample folder contains a sample program that demonstrates using a Mouse or Controller with GVRf.
It makes use of the IO framework to generate InputEvents for the GVRInputManager. 

Game Controllers supported for now:
1) Samsung Gamepad
2) Steel Series Stratus XL
3) Sony Dualshock 3 (tested using an USB OTG cable)
3) Sony Dualshock 4 (tested using an USB OTG cable)

Note: For Bluetooth controllers make sure that the controller is paired with the Samsung Device 
before launching the app.

Known Issues:
1) USB Mice can only be connected to Gear VR devices that have a USB port (via an USB OTG cable).

2) The standard Android mouse pointer shows up in the VR mode.

This issue has been fixed and should not affect Android devices that have been updated after 
September 2015. Make sure you have pulled the latest Android updates if the issue still persists.

Note that the pointer only disappears when the device is docked in the VR headset. It still shows 
up when developing using the developer mode.

3) Apps closing when the USB dongle is plugged in or removed.
